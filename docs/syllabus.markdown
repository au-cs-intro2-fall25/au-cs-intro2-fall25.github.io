## Coronavirus Policies

For more information about general policies regarding American University's response to COVID-19, please refer to the full [memo](https://www.american.edu/coronavirus/).

## Academic Integrity

Sharing code on individual assignments or between groups on group assignments is strictly forbidden - this is a
form of plagiarism. There is rarely one single
correct way to write code that solves a problem. While we want you to feel free to discuss your approach with your classmates, you should know that there are often many solutions for a given problem, and it's typically obvious when one
student shares code with another. If you directly copy and paste code from the Internet (or even the text), cite your
source in your comments (but also ensure that you understand what the code is doing - not all code on the web is good!).
Assignments will be checked using plagiarism detection software and by hand to ensure the originality of the work.

Do not share your code with anyone other than a partner on group assignments. Do not show or share your work with other students, even just for a second. Do not let someone look at your screen. You may get behind, or
your friend may ask for help, but the consequences for plagiarism are far worse than an incomplete submission - for the
submission, you will still likely get some points. If I suspect that you have purposely shared code with another student
or presented someone else's work as your own, the matter will be referred to the CAS Academic Integrity Code Administrator
for adjudication. If you are found responsible for an academic integrity violation, sanctions can include a failing
grade for the course, suspension for one or more academic terms, dismissal from the university, or other measures as
deemed appropriate by the Dean.

All students are expected to adhere to the [American University Honor Code](https://www.american.edu/academics/integrity/code.cfm). Any questions regarding general rules and regulations should first be directed to the American
University [Catalog](https://www.american.edu/provost/registrar/university_catalog.cfm). If you still have questions,
please seek out the TA or Instructor during the posted office hours.

### ChatGPT and AI-Generated Writing Models
In this course, solutions to coding exercises generated by AI-Generated writing models like ChatGPT are considered academic plagiarism, and will be referred to the Academic Integrity Office of American University just as if you had copied the work of a friend, website, or online tutor. While we encourage you to create an OpenAI account and play around with this and other AI-Generated tools, you should not use it to generate complete solutions to the homework problems in this course that you submit as your own work. It is reasonable to expect that tools like this will eventually be integrated into the workflows of many businesses in the future, however, while you are still learning the fundamentals of computer science the process of designing algorithms and writing code is just as important as the final product. You will be instructed early in the course how to document that process in a way that provides evidence that your work is your own. 

## Class Participation

It is expected that students will come to class, be prepared by doing the readings, and will pay attention and
participate in discussions. Participation is scored by completion of assigned readings and in-class activities.

### Attendance

You are required to attend all lectures. If you need to miss class for any reason, you are allowed two excused
absences - no questions asked. Prolonged absences must be discussed with the instructor and are not guaranteed to be
excused.

### Use of Computers and Cell Phones in Class

[Educational research](http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2014/04/22/0956797614524581.abstract) shows that taking
notes by hand on paper will lead to better retention of material than taking notes by typing. Also, in the past
classrooms have had issues with students not only not paying attention but also disrupting others during class - by
playing games, by accidentally clicking on a video with the sound on, etc.

If you have a laptop, you should bring it to class. Do not use it for in-class assignments unless you are directly
advised to do so by the instructor. Throughout the semester we will frequently pause lecture to work together to solve
programming challenges in groups.

Please do not use your cell phone in class. 

### Software Tools

In this course you will utilize an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) to write code. While many IDEs exist, examples and in-class support videos will utilize [PyCharm by Jetbrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/). It is freely available to students through an academic license and supports all the software development features that we will use in this course. 

All [assignments](/assignments) will be delivered to students and submitted back to the instructor through [GitHub](https://github.com/). If you do not already have an account, you should sign up for one prior to the beginning of class. Early lectures will discuss the possible methods of submitting assignments to help you determine what is most comfortable for you, but the recommended method is to use the built-in GitHub integration available within IntelliJ IDEA. 

See the [resources](/resources) section for more information on the software tools used in this course. 

### Audio/Camera Policy

If meeting virtually, se strongly encourage you to turn on your camera during meetings and remote office hours. Faculty and students reported virtual classes are much better when we can see your faces because there is more visual communication, more engagement, sense of community and less multitasking. However, we understand that sometimes you can’t turn on your camera due to connectivity issues or privacy concerns. If you can’t connect with a camera, please upload a photo of yourself onto Zoom. If you have connectivity issues, please contact techtaskforce@american.edu.

## Homework

Homework will be graded on a rubric of requirements that are expected to work correctly (e.g., returning the correct output for
a given input). For most requirements, you will receive either a check plus (100%), check (90%), check minus (75%), X (50%), or no credit. Most tasks will receive a
check. A project receiving all check pluses
will receive 100% of credit, while a project receiving all checks will receive a 90%. A project receiving minuses for
all tasks will receive about 75% of credit, and a project that receives an X for all tasks will receive about 50% of
credit or less. Tasks may be weighted differently to account for differences in difficulty or time. These are general
guidelines to let you know what to expect. Grading on specific assignments may differ.

All assignments will be submitted through the class GitHub system, which will be introduced in early lectures. Students
are allowed to work in pairs (no groups larger than two people unless directed otherwise) but you must specify who you worked with, and it must be
clear that both students contributed (you will identify who did what in your submission). Students working together must
equally contribute to the projects. Project submissions will be reviewed to ensure balanced contribution for paired
submissions - grades will be scaled in situations where it becomes clear that one student did all the work. 

- **Project submissions must be free of runtime errors.** It is very difficult to evaluate the functionality of code that has runtime errors. Please ensure that your projects have good syntax and run without halting before you consider them complete.
- **Many students misinterpret the way that submission works on GitHub.** This is not a "one and done" system where you only submit once (like Canvas). Instead, think of it like an online backup system (e.g., DropBox, Google Drive). Every time you make progress, it's a good idea to upload the latest version to your online repo. This is not counted as your submission until the deadline is reached. Uploading not only lets you back up your work off your computer in case of hardware errors, it also makes it easier for your instructor or TA to provide early feedback or help you get unstuck. Upload often!

### Late Submission

Assignments are due at the beginning of class on the specified date unless stated otherwise. Assignments turned in after
this time will be penalized with a letter grade (10%) for each 24-hour period after the initial deadline. Submissions
received 72 hours after the deadline will be accepted but can receive no more that 70% of the available course credit. Any program features that are incomplete and do not execute during runtime will not receive full credit.
Some projects are larger than the others, and many are quite larger than homework assigned in the previous course. 
Students are therefore given multiple weeks to complete them. Waiting until the last minute is a recipe for disaster - 
if you are stuck, come to office hours for the instructor or TA ASAP to get unstuck!

## Exams

Exams cover the material from the lectures, projects, and reading. While not necessarily cumulative, each exam will
require understanding many of the concepts covered in the preceding exams. Exams consist of multiple choice, short
answer, and long answer questions. 

Exams will be completed by hand on paper - we recommend you buy 4x4 graph rule paper to class to practice writing code. Graph paper will be distributed during exams for you to use on longer problems.  

The final exam is cumulative: half of the final exam will be material covered for prior exams, half will be material
that is new since the previous exam.

## Grading for Section 001 & 002
- Attendance and Participation: 5%
- Quiz on Canvas: 5% 
- HW Projects: 20%
- Midterm Exams (2x 17.5 ea.): 35%

## Students with Disabilities

If you wish to receive accommodations for a disability, please notify me with a letter from the Academic Support and
Access Center. As accommodations are not retroactive, timely notification at the beginning of the semester, if possible,
is strongly recommended. To register with a disability or for questions about disability accommodations, contact the
Academic Support and Access Center at 202-885-3360 or [asac@american.edu](mailto:asac@american.edu), or drop by the ASAC in MGC 243.

## Academic Support

All students may take advantage of the Academic Support and Access Center (ASAC) for individual academic skills
counseling, workshops, Tutoring, peer tutor referrals, and Supplemental Instruction. The ASAC is located in Mary Graydon
Center 243. Additional academic support resources available at AU include the Bender Library, the Writing Center (
located in the Library), the Math Lab (located in Don Meyers Technology and Innovation Building), and the Center for
Language Exploration, Acquisition, & Research (CLEAR) in Anderson Hall. A more complete list of campus-wide resources is
available in the ASAC.

## Tutoring

The Peer-Assisted Student Support (PASS) Program offers free, online tutoring in CSC-208. The PASS Program also provides tutoring in 20+ courses to students enrolled at AU in computer science, accounting, biology, chemistry, and several other academic disciplines. 

For more information, visit the [Peer-Assisted Student Support](https://www.american.edu/provost/academic-access/tutor-services.cfm) resources page online. To view the tutoring schedule, see supported courses, and to meet with PASS Tutors, please visit [WCOnline](https://american.mywconline.net/).
